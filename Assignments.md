# Assignments

### Coding
The main assignments of the class will be two series of work, revolving around two concepts, Still and Motion. Each student will be required to produce a series of work that demonstrate both (a) technical skill, (b) aesthetic judgement and (c) critical knowledge, which will then be presented and critiqued in class. The final project will follow those guidelines, but will not have a pre-defined prompt.

15% + 15% + 20% (percentage of final grade for each assignment)

### Writing
Each of the main assignments will be accompanied by a 500 word statement providing a theoretical context to the production of the work, in order to introduce students to not only art creation but also to art criticism and allow them to not only produce, but communicate. These statements will have to touch on (a) the conceptual background for the work, (b) the reasons for its formal qualities as well as (c) the evolution of the work over time.

5% + 5% + 10% (percentage of final grade for each assignment written statement)

## Assignment 1 - Still

Create a series of still images

Grading will rely on:

* **shapes**: do your images represent a balance/a dynamic? why did you choose this/these shape/s? how did you draw it/them? what does it/do they evoke?

* **color**: what feeling are your colors supposed to convey? are they deliberately dissonant or consonant? what medium did you decide to display it on?

* **rules**: what is/are the rule/s that you decided upon to make this series? how obvious are they? what is the input? how much/little diversity does it offer?

* **write-up**: explain your creative process, your inspirations and your decision to stop at a certain point. are you satisfied with the work (it's ok not to be)? did you achieve what you expected? did you end up somewhere unexpected?

### Deliverables
* Link to source code and writeup submitted via Brightspace->Assignments->Assignment 1
* Include at least 2 images in your writeup


## Assignment 2 - Motion

Create an animation

Grading will rely on:

* **shapes/color**: is your image visually pleasing? how does the shape of the image relate with its colors? i there intended harmony or discord?

* **r/evolution**: what kind of r/evolution is your piece based on (repetitive/random/semi-random/etc.)? what makes it move? what is the progression of the piece?

* **concept**: what is the conceptual component of your piece? what idea does it represent? how accessible is that idea from a purely visual standpoint?

* **write-up**: explain your creative process, your inspirations and your decision to stop at a certain point. are you satisfied with the work (it's ok not to be)? did you achieve what you expected? did you end up somewhere unexpected?

### Deliverables
* Link to source code and writeup submitted via Brightspace->Assignments->Assignment 2
* Include at least 2 images in your writeup
* Record a video from your app and upload to Vimeo/YouTube/etc or Google Drive. Provide a link to the video (or embed it) in the writeup


## Assignment 3 - Final

Create a piece of software art

Make it so that you can control it live (either by pressing keys, moving your mouse, or using GUI)
over one to two minutes, by manipulating the visuals on the screen

Grading is based on the combined rubrics of both still and motion:

* shapes
* colors
* rules
* concept
* story
* write-up

### Deliverables
* Link to source code and writeup submitted via Brightspace->Assignments->Assignment 3
* Include at least 2 images in your writeup
* Record a video from your app and upload to Vimeo/YouTube/etc or Google Drive. Provide a link to the video (or embed it) in the writeup
* Make a 2-3 minute performance in class!
