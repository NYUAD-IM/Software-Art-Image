# NYUAD - Interactive Media Syllabus Software Art: Image
This course counts towards the following NYUAD degree requirement:<br/>
* Multidisciplinary Minors > Interactive Media
* Majors > Art and Art History

## Course Description
Although computers only appeared a few decades ago, automation, repetition and process are concepts that have been floating around artists’ minds for almost a century. As machines enabled us to operate on a different scale, they escaped the domain of the purely functional and started to be used, and understood, by artists. The result has been the emergence of code-based art, a relatively new field in the rich tradition of arts history that today acts as an accessible new medium in the practice of visual artists, sculptors, musicians and performers.
Software Art: Image is an introduction to the history, theory and practice of computer-aided artistic endeavours in the field of visual arts. This class will focus on the appearance of computers as a new tool for artists to integrate in their artistic practice, how it shaped a specific aesthetic language and what it reveals about technology and art today. We will be elaborating and discussing concepts and paradigms specific to computing platforms, such as system art, generative art, image processing and motion art. Drawing on those, students will explore their own artistic practice through the exclusive use of their computers. The course will also serve as a technical introduction to the OpenFrameworks programming environment to create works of visual art. As such, Software Art: Image will be an art history and critical studies course with a studio component. This computational playground will highlight and reflect upon the broader impact of digital technologies on our relationship to art and art-making.

Software Art: Image is a complement to Software Art: Text, a 7-week course approaching computation from the perspective of poetry and fiction.The two courses can be taken in series or independently.

## Course Objectives
When the course is finished, students will:
* Have developed an understanding of process-based artistic practice.
* Have been introduced to the history and impact of software on visual arts and culture. • Have developed their own artistic voice through writing software.
* Be accustomed to presenting and discussing software-based artworks.
* Have developed a familiarity creating visual work in C++ and OpenFrameworks.
* Have developed a critical outlook on art and aesthetics in the digital age.


## Course Assignments
This course consists of both theoretical discussion and in hands-on assignments. The course assignments will therefore include readings, writing, presenting and coding.

### Reading 
Readings will include book chapters, research papers and articles from art history, art philosophy and software studies fields. These readings will introduce the students to the history of computers as a tool to produce artworks, its impact on how we look at art, as well as an overview of the field’s main figures.

### Participating
Since the class will be focused on critical outlooks on artworks as well as discussion of both their execution and underlying concepts, participation by the students contributes to 15% of the final grade. Participation includes (a) expressing one’s own perspective on the readings, (b) discussing and elaborating your opinion on artworks shown in class, (c) offering critical and respectful feedback on classmates’ work, (d) sharing additional content that can be relevant to the topics discussed in class.
* 15%

### Sketching
Students will be encouraged to produce computer artworks by posting weekly sketches on a public blog. These weekly assignments will explore a particular technique, concept, or artist who will have been discussed that week in class. Each sketch or series of sketches will be accompanied by a short write-up explaining the creative process of that exploration.
* 15%

### Coding
The main assignments of the class will be two series of work, revolving around two concepts, Still and Motion. Each student will be required to produce a series of work that demonstrate both (a) technical skill, (b) aesthetic judgement and (c) critical knowledge, which will then be presented and critiqued in class. The final project will follow those guidelines, but will not have a pre-defined prompt.
* 15% + 15% + 20%

### Writing
Each of the main assignments will be accompanied by a 500 word statement providing a theoretical context to the production of the work, in order to introduce students to not only art creation but also to art criticism and allow them to not only produce, but communicate. These statements will have to touch on (a) the conceptual background for the work, (b) the reasons for its formal qualities as well as (c) the evolution of the work over time.
* 5% + 5% + 10%

## Submitting Assignments
Each assignment should be submitted by (1) posting the output on the student’s website, and by (2a) sending the direct link to that posting to the instructor as an email, along with (2b) a .zip file of the files.

## Grade breakdown
* Participating 15%
* Sketching 15%
* Coding - Still 20%
* Coding - Motion 20%
* Coding - Final 30%
* Total 100%

## Grade calculation
 
Students will be given grades based on a 100 point scale. Each assignment will be graded on a point scale, and these points will be added up to determine the final grade, according to the following: 
* 94-100 A
* 90-93 A-
* 86-89 B+
* 83-85 B
* 80-82 B-
* 76-79 C+ etc.

## Readings
Readings are available through NYU Classes->Resources and at https://github.com/periode/software-art-image/tree/master/assets/readings/required.

 
The required theoretical reading is Interaction of Color, by Josef Albers, Yale University Press, 2013 (available through NYU Classes->Resources)

The required practical reading is ofBook, by Zach Lieberman et. al., https://github.com/openframeworks/ofBook/

## Attendance
Attendance and arriving on time to all class sessions is required and expected, too many unexcused absences will lower your final grade. Two unexcused absences lower your final grade by a letter. Each subsequent unexcused absence will lower another letter grade. Two tardies will count as one absence. Arriving more than 15 minutes late will also count as an absence. If you will be missing a class due to illness, or unavoidable personal circumstances, you must notify your professor in advance via email for the absence to be eligible to be excused.

## Laptop Use
As it turns out, digital media are more and more designed to take our attention away from our current actions. As such, laptops, tablets and smartphones are not allowed during lectures. In order to avoid wasteful printing of materials, students are encouraged to take notes and write down questions as preparation for class discussions.

## Academic Integrity
As set forth in NYU Abu Dhabi's Academic Integrity Policy, the relationship between students and faculty at NYU Abu Dhabi is defined by a shared commitment to academic excellence and is grounded in an expectation of fairness, honesty, and respect, which are essential to maintaining the integrity of the community. Every student who enrolls and everyone who accepts an appointment as a member of the faculty or staff at NYU Abu Dhabi agrees to abide by the expectation of academic honesty.
